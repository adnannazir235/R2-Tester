Additional Notes:

> This project is still under development and lacks many planned features. It was built to understand how to exchange data with the backend service. While it demonstrates core functionalities, it's primarily an educational project and not intended for production use. Explore the code to learn about API request handling and local data storage, but be mindful of its limitations.
